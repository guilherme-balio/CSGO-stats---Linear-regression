# CSGO player ratings prediction using Linear-regression

E-sports have been on the rise for years, among these, CSGO have been consistenly one of the most popular games on the scene. The 'rating' of a player aims to quantify it's ability and performance and, as such, it is a very interesting feature for coaches, analists, and enthusiasts.

However, the actual formula and methods used to determine this feature are currently not known. This project attemps to create a model that can predict a player rating and, hopefully, output a satisfying estimate for upcoming players (or for your own game analisys!).
